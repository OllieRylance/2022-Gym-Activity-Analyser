# 2022-Gym-Activity-Analyser
## Overview

Since I started going to the gym, I have kept a log of every set of every exercise I have done. The purpose of this is for a project like this where I analyse the information and display the data in an easy-to-digest manner.

I created two versions ("g.py" and "g - new.py") of this with functionality that I didn't end up fully completing or merging.

What the two versions of the activitity analyser generally looks like is shown in "page view.png".

Now that I have found this program I have decided that I will redo the project in the future when I get the time because I still keep track of what I do and still do not have a very good method of analysing it.
