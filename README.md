# 2022-Gym-Activity-Analyser
## Overview

Since I started going to the gym, I have kept a log of every set of every exercise I have done. The purpose of this is for a project like this where I analyse the information and display the data in an easy-to-digest manner.

I created two versions ("g.py" and "g - new.py") of this with functionality that I didn't end up fully completing or merging.

What the two versions of the activitity analyser generally looks like is shown in "page view.png".

Now that I have found this program I have decided that I will redo the project in the future when I get the time because I still keep track of what I do and still do not have a very good method of analysing it.

## Technical Description

### "g.txt" - Storage

This file is filled by copying and pasting the raw google sheet of gym data that I have into a text document. This leads to data in line separated by tabs (\t). In both of the version of the document, the document is processed in the same way:
- Splitting the lines by tabs (\t),
- Knowing that (this is illustrated in the "google sheet example image.png"):
  - Every three columns (every three '\t's) is a new month of the sheet,
  - Every day is separated by a blank line followed by the date and type of day on one line,
- Splitting information by days based on the information above,
- Splitting days into a list of exercises containing an exercise name and information on the sets.

### "g.py" - Version 1



### "g - new.py" - Version 2
